            | The SVG icon system is based on directly embedding SVG files into the markup. Within Bedrock, we use Jade to render these SVG's instead of
            | having to inline them. You can either inline them, or build a solution that does it for you.

        p
            | The SVG content should be contained in a <code>.svg-icon</code> div that also get an icon-specific class based on its
            | name (or example: <code>.svg-icon.svg-icon-add</code>. This allows us to style and colorize specific icons.
