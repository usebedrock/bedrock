The MDC Dialog component is a spec-aligned dialog component adhering to the Material Design dialog pattern. It implements a modal dialog window. You may notice that full screen components outlined in the dialog spec do not appear in MDC Dialog. This is because they have been deemed to be outside of the scope of what a dialog should be.
