### Information

This project is a maintained solution for HTML/CSS prototyping for over 5 years.

We welcome contributions. We think companies interested in delivering front-end design systems to their clients could make good use of Bedrock.

Are you a dev with JS and node.js experience or willing to learn through contributing to open source? Look around the issues for issues with a “help wanted” tag and make your first contribution via a PR!

### Policy

We will not tolerate any harmful conduct and aim to create a nice open source community space to work in.
